      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Fusion Behavioral Care is a mental health practice serving patients across New Hampshire.
        My goal was to design a patient-first website that emphasized clarity, accessibility,
        and secure communication without compromising UX or unintentionally handling protected health information.
        <br><br>
        Because Wix does not provide native HIPAA compliance, I designed workflows that safely redirect sensitive interactions
        through approved Microsoft platforms (Forms and internal messaging hubs) while keeping the public-facing site clean,
        navigable, and informational-only.
      </p>

      <!-- MY ROLE -->
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and structured page flows using Wix Editor with clarity-driven navigation and mobile-first layout</li>
        <li>Created a secure messaging system using Microsoft Forms, embedded only in member-restricted pages</li>
        <li>Built a protected membership system — only approved patients can register, access secure pages, or submit forms</li>
        <li>Configured form routing to direct submissions directly into internal messaging workflows (without storing data on the website)</li>
        <li>Created branded business cards and QR-enabled print assets that link back to secure sections of the website</li>
        <li>Wrote the official Privacy Policy and Accessibility Statement for transparency and compliance</li>
        <li>Designed visual identity assets in Canva, including logo usage, color cohesion, and QR-integrated print collateral</li>
        <li>Added a member-only “Report an Issue” ticket page for ongoing site maintenance input from approved patients</li>
        <li>Configured and designed the Wix mobile app experience for the practice, adapting content, layout, and role-based access for patients and staff on mobile devices</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- HIGHLIGHTS -->
      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear “top three” navigation actions: <em>Call • Directions • Patient Portal</em> to support real patient needs</li>
        <li>Brand-aligned design using calming blue and neutral tones, reflecting trust and professionalism</li>
        <li>Visibility improvements via structured page titles, semantic headings, alt-text, and metadata</li>
        <li>Designed Canva-based branded logo, business cards, and QR codes for physical/digital continuity</li>
        <li>Restricted member system ensures protected content only seen by approved patients and staff</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- SECURITY / ACCESS -->
      <h2>Security & Access Control</h2>
      <p>
        Since Wix is not a HIPAA-compliant data storage platform, I built a secure workaround:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Created Microsoft Form workflows routed directly to the internal message hub (Shielding PHI from website storage)</li>
        <li>Restricted membership — only vetted patients are granted access to pages with secure submission options</li>
        <li>Designed forms that allow patients to initiate contact safely without transmitting protected details</li>
        <li>Added a secure ticket submission page (Report an Issue) — for approved site users only</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES -->
      <h2>What This Project Demonstrates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding of UX design principles in healthcare and mental health settings</li>
        <li>Ability to creatively implement HIPAA-aware web workflows using Microsoft and Wix capabilities</li>
        <li>Experience creating secure form logic, controlled membership access, and compliance documentation</li>
        <li>Skill in brand identity design across web, print, and mobile mediums</li>
        <li>Understanding of cross-platform user experience — designed both web and mobile app interfaces using the same brand system</li>
      </ul>
