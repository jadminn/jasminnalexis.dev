<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Mother’s Meadow is a newly launched pick-your-own blueberry farm in Brandon, Vermont.
I designed the full online presence to help them establish their brand, attract visitors,
and communicate key seasonal updates. In addition to building the WordPress site, I created
the logo, branding assets, and photography myself — and linked the website to their newly
created Facebook business page for announcements, engagement, and visitor updates.
</p>
<h2>My Role</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and built the WordPress website using a custom layout focused on clarity, warmth, and simplicity</li>
  <li>Collaborated closely with the farm owner to define brand tone, messaging, and seasonal communication strategy</li>
  <li>Created the logo, brand palette, banner graphics, and image assets using Canva</li>
  <li>Shot and edited original photography on-site, including landscapes, farm rows, signage, and blueberries</li>
  <li>Set up the official Facebook business page and linked it to the website for cross-platform announcements</li>
  <li>Wrote content for homepage, FAQ, seasonal updates, and pick-your-own guidelines</li>
  <li>Created a mobile-friendly layout for farm visitors accessing the site from the field</li>
</ul>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Designed the farm’s visual identity — logo, color palette, and photography-based branding</li>
  <li>Created social media presence (Facebook Business Page) and connected it to the website for real-time updates</li>
  <li>Developed educational content on berry varieties, farm etiquette, and growing process</li>
  <li>Designed fully mobile-responsive layouts for visitors using phones while at the farm</li>
  <li>Used Canva and Photoshop to create graphics and identity pieces that extend beyond the website</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brand Identity & Visual Design</h2>
<p>
I developed the farm's visual identity from the ground up — designing logos, signage,
Facebook header graphics, and promotional images using Canva and original photography.
The branding reflects the rustic, local, and family-owned nature of the farm.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Created logo variations for web, print, and social media use</li>
  <li>Designed Canva-based branded banners and promotional seasonal graphics</li>
  <li>Shot original photography on-site to ensure authentic visuals</li>
  <li>Designed Facebook cover photo and social profile imagery consistent with branding</li>
</ul>
<h2>What This Project Demonstrates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to design both a website and full brand identity for a new business</li>
  <li>Experience combining WordPress, Canva design, real photography, and social media strategy</li>
  <li>Understanding of mobile usability for outdoor/location-based businesses</li>
  <li>Skill in working directly with a real business owner to translate mission into visual identity</li>
</ul>
